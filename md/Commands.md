- The server to which a client is connected is required to parse the complete message, and return any appropriate errors.
- If multiple parameters is presented, then each MUST be checked for validity and appropriate responses MUST be sent back to the client.

#### Registration
- The RECOMMENDED order for a client to register is as follows:
	1. PASS message
	2. NICK message 
	3. USER message
	4. Service message

- If the selected nickname during registration is already in use, the server must iteratively modify it until an available one is found and must **send error message to the client `ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE`**.  The procedure is illustrated using the example nickname 'lola':

	- Initially, an underscore is appended to the original nickname, resulting in 'lola_'.
	- If this modified nickname is still taken, sequential numbers are added starting from 1. For instance: 'lola1', 'lola2', and so forth, until an available nickname is obtained, such as 'lola10', 'lola11', and beyond.
##### Replies upon registration:
The server sends Replies 001 to 004 to a user upon successful registration.

###### 001   RPL_WELCOME 
- indicates that the connection is now registered and known the to the entire IRC network. The reply message MUST contain the full client identifier upon which it was registered.

```
":<serverName> 001 Welcome to the Internet Relay Network <nick>!<user>@<host>"
```
###### 002    RPL_YOURHOST
```
:<serverName> 002 Your host is <servername>, running version <ver>
```

###### 003    RPL_CREATED

```
:<serverName> 003 This server was created <date>
```

###### 004    RPL_MYINFO
```
:<serverName> 004 <servername> <version> <available user modes> <available channel modes>
```
#### PASS
- A "PASS" command is not required for a client connection to be registered, but it MUST precede the latter of the NICK/USER combination (for a user connection)

#### OPER
`/OPER <name> <password>`

#### JOIN
- ` /JOIN <channel>` -> enter a channel
- ` /JOIN <channel>,<channel2>,<channel#N>` -> enter several channels at once
- 
- `JOIN 0` -> leave all all currently joined channels.
- Servers MUST be able to parse arguments in the form of a list of target, but SHOULD NOT use lists when sending JOIN messages to clients.
- If a JOIN is successful, the user receives a JOIN message as confirmation and is then sent the channelâ€™s topic (using **`RPL_TOPIC`**) and the list of users who are on the channel (using **`RPL_NAMREPLY`**), which MUST include the user joining.

- Note that this message accepts a special argument ("0"), which is  a special request to leave all channels the user is currently a member of. The server will process this message as if the user had sent  a PART command (See Section 3.2.2) for each channel he is a member  of.

#### INVITE

`KICK <user> [:]<comment>`
`KICK <channel> <user> [:][<comment>]`
`KICK <channel> *( "," <channel> ) <user> *( "," <user> )[<comment>]`
- It causes the `<user>` to PART from the `<channel>` by force.
- For the message to be syntactically correct, there MUST be either one channel parameter and multiple user parameter, or as many channel parameters as there are user parameters.

#### PING
 ` PING <server1> [ <server2> ]`
- The PING command is used to test the presence of an active client or server at the other end of the connection. 
- Servers send a PING message at regular intervals if no other activity detected coming from a connection. If a connection fails to respond to a PING message within a set amount of time, that connection is closed. 
- A PING message MAY be sent even if the connection is active.
- When a PING message is received, the appropriate PONG message MUST be sent as reply to `<server1>` (server which sent the PING message out) as soon as possible.
##### Replies: 
ERR_NOORIGIN
ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
#### PONG
`PONG <server>

- PONG message is a reply to ping message.
- The `<server>` parameter is the name of the entity who has responded to PING message and generated this message.

Numeric Replies:  
ERR_NOORIGIN 
ERR_NOSUCHSERVER

#### PRIVMSG
`PRIVMSG <msgtarget> <text to be sent>`
- `PRIVMSG` is used to send private messages between users, as well as to send messages to channels.



- /part  -> exits the current channel
- /part channel -> exit a channel
- /window close ->exit a private message
