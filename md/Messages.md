- Servers and clients send each other messages which may **or may not** generate a reply.
- If the message contains a valid command, the client should expect a reply as specified but it is not advised to wait forever for the reply; **client to server and server to server communication is essentially asynchronous in nature.**
-  The server to which a client is connected is required to parse the complete message, and return any appropriate errors.
- IRC messages are always lines of characters **terminated with a CR-LF** ( `\r\n` ) pair, and these messages SHALL NOT exceed **512 characters** in length, counting all characters **including the trailing CR-LF**. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed for the command and its parameters.
- Each IRC message may consist of up to **three main parts**: 
	- the prefix (optional)
	- the command
	- the command parameters (of which there may be up to 15).  
	- The prefix, command, and all parameters are separated by one (**or more**) ASCII space character(s) (0x20).
- The **prefix** is used by servers to indicate the true **origin of the message**. If the prefix is missing from the message, it is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was received from.
- Empty messages are silently ignored. Empty messages contain CR-LF pair caracters.
- CR and LF are message separators.
- The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients to communicate with each other. **`PRIVMSG`**, **`NOTICE`** and **`SQUERY`** are the only messages available which actually perform delivery of a text message from one client to another
